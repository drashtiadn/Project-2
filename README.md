# Project-2

Exercise 1: Customer Segmentation

For this exercise, consider you are a data scientist at a large retail company. The company wants to 
understand its customers better to tailor marketing and sales efforts. You are tasked with segmenting 
the company's customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior.

Dataset:

We will be working with the "Wholesale customers Data Set" dataset available on Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/binovi/wholesale-customers-data-set]




Exercise 2: Image Compression

In this exercise, you will apply K-Means clustering to image compression. By reducing the number of 
colors used in an image, you can compress the image's size without significantly reducing its quality.
